		<p> Raviraj Pophale. Or as his friends call him 'Mukya'. The reason behind that is, if talking was like having sex, then he would be a virgin. He comes from a town which lies in the outskirts of Pune. He had his primary and secondary education there. While he was there, he was always trying to gain more information regarding computers and how they work. He also tried to gain information about girls and their pussy. Computers always fascinated him. He liked how computers reduced human efforts by so much and there is so much to do on them. He even declared that if he could fuck a computer, he would. He used to wonder when he could get his hands on one. Fortunately he bought one when he reached his eighth grade. And there started his journey towards computer and computer science.</p> <p>		Raviraj explored different topics on the computer and enjoyed them thoroughly. He started with baby steps each time and ended up learning everything gradually one by one. Like he started with google images for mallu porn and then later once he learned everything, he started getting the porn from the dark net. He studied in a Polytechnic college where he learned the engineering aspects of computer more deeply. He understood how software is made. He understood the paradigms of software development here. He was deeply over joyed by the fact that someone out there is making software so that he could watch porn. </p><p>		Raviraj is now a Computer Engineering student and is an apprentice in most of the modern computer practices. Not coding though, he just copy pastes the code from the internet and then makes fun of the professor. Also, he makes his friend write code for him while he fucks bitches. Raviraj also has business expertise as he is famous for being a ‘wallpaper wala’ in his neighbourhood. He is the best in the business. He doesn’t like competition and hence if he finds anyone trying to compete, he fucks with them. Because he believes in the saying – ‘Nadla ki todla’. He is so good in his business that the Vietnamese people are scared of him. Forget the Vietnamese, even Hillary Clinton is sacred of Raviraj since he likes to spoof emails. If you get an email which looks suspicious, don’t worry at all, it’s just Raviraj playing his little game. Raviraj also develops Android apps. And by development, I mean, building apks from readymade code. He also used to blog a few years back where he wrote 4 articles in total.</p><p>		Raviraj plans to go to United States soon. There he plans to visit Mountain View California where Google’s head office lies. He wants to go to each and every tester there and spank them on their ass. <p/><p>		Other than this, Raviraj likes Cricket as a sport and appreciates Sachin Tendulkar (who actually doesn’t play that good). When Raviraj is scared, he doesn’t recite Hanuman Chalisa, he simply says “haila, definitely” and adjusts his crotch guard and the fear goes away. </p>
